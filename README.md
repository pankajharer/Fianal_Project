# Project Statement:

The current car rental process is cumbersome, with limited vehicle options, complex booking procedures, and unclear pricing structures. There is a growing demand for a user-friendly car rental website that offers a wide selection of vehicles, transparent pricing, and an easy booking system.
 
# Project Description:

The VehiGo car rental website is designed to revolutionize the car rental experience by offering a user-friendly and feature-rich platform. With a wide selection of vehicles from trusted providers, customers can easily find their ideal rental car for any occasion. The website provides an intuitive search interface that allows users to filter and sort vehicles based on their preferences, such as car type, price range, and location.
Each vehicle listing includes detailed information and high-quality images, ensuring customers have all the necessary details to make an informed decision. VehiGo's transparent pricing and straightforward booking process enable users to book their desired vehicle quickly and securely.
